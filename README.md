### Check out the live app here: https://jasleen0604.github.io/
### Features:
This web-application takes input of geographical location from user (it can be done automatically as well as manually). Then by the help of Openweather API, the Air Quality Index of that location is provided to the user along with the exact concentration of various Air Pollutants like Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Ozone, Sulphur Dioxide, etc. It also gives health recommendations and prevention measures based on the AQI of that region.
